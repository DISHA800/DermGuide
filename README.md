# DermGuide

DermGuide is a solution for diagnosing various skin diseases using machine learning. With just one click, users can upload an image of their skin condition and receive a prediction for the disease it may indicate. This prediction model has been developed using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, trained on a dataset of skin disease images.


Future Scope:
In the future, we plan to integrate DermAid into an application, providing users with easy access to dermatological diagnosis. This will help to have a user-friendly interface and ensuring seamless integration with other features such as image capture.
