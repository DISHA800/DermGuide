# DermGuide - Skin Disease Classification using ResNet

Introduction
DermGuide is a machine learning project focused on classifying various skin diseases using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, specifically ResNet. The project utilizes PyTorch and Torchvision for model implementation and training, and involves data preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization techniques to ensure robust model performance. This project is trained over 23 classes of skin diseases.


Features
- Pretrained ResNet Model: Utilizes ResNet101 and ResNet18 models pretrained on ImageNet for transfer learning.
- Data Augmentation: Applies various transformations such as random resized cropping, horizontal flipping, and normalization.
- Custom Dataset Class: Handles loading and transforming images from the dataset directory.
- Visualization: Includes data visualization techniques to better understand dataset characteristics.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Trains the model on the dataset and evaluates its performance on the test set.

Results
Acheived the accuracy of 60.59%.
